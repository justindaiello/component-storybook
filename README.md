# Component Storybook

This is a work in progress collection of components that I find myself using on various projects in some form or fashion. I'll be adding to this over time and this is just the beginning of an ongoing project.

## Running the project

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/justindaiello/component-storybook.git`

Install dependencies:

`yarn install`

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn storybook`

Opens the storybook app on an open port.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Components

Components can be found in `/src/components`

All components are written using TypeScript, and Styled Components

## Stories

Stories can be found in `/src/stories`

All stories are written using Typescript

## Reuse

If you like any components then please feel free to reuse them or use them as inspiration for your own versions. These components are the result of trial and error, working with other developers, and inspiration from others online. I'm more than happy to keep sharing the love - just give the repo a star if you reuse something!
