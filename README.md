# Component Storybook

This is a work in progress collection of components that I find myself using on various projects in some form or fashion. I'll be adding to this over time and this is just the beginning of an ongoing project.

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn storybook`

Opens the storybook app on an open port\

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Components

Components can be found in `/src/components`

## Stories

Stories can be found in `/src/stories`
